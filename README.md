Protomorph usage
================

This simply pulls down protomorph, extends it's configs and provides an
example of a simple yarn setup.

Configs extended:
- protomorph karma.base.conf.js
- protomorph webpack.conf.js

If you are using VSCode or similar, you can configure the eslint, htmlhint and
sasslint to point to the config files in protomorph. Just ensure to gitignore
the .vscode folder.
